# Meal Planner App

## Welcome to my Javascript app!

Here a user can create their own meal planner! A user is able to create new meals and add them to categories. The single page app allows you to toggle between views and also show/ close the form to add a new meal to the page. 

Once you add a new meal it will automatically be added to the appropriate category on the view page and it will create its own square on the meal view page. 

## Install Instructions

To begin using this app, clone the repo, run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate`, and then run `shotgun`.
